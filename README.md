# Multiple Comparison Mice Genetics

This project is part of my final evaluation in my statistics in action course at Ecole Polytechnique.
We were tasked to run a series of single and multiple comparison tests on data representing genome sequences from mice.

Special attention was devoted to controling both the false discovery rate by appling p-value correction methods (Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg).
